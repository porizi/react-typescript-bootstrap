# React + Typescript bootstrap

This repo is a bootstrap project to help you get started with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) & [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It uses [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to do the compilation & bundling and [typings](https://github.com/typings/typings) for fetching the type definitions.

Please follow the instructions below to get started:

### Get Started

To get started, clone or download the code from this repo, open up the root folder and run the following commands:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`

2. Install webpack globally (if you don't have it already): `npm install -g webpack`

3. Run webpack in watch mode: `webpack --watch`

4. Run a webserver in local directory: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

### Installing type definitions

We are using [typings](https://github.com/typings/typings) for installing type definitions.

1. Install typings globally: `npm install -g typings`

2. Search for a type definition (eg. react): `typings search react`

3. Install the typing of your choice (remember to prefix it with the source): `typings install dt-react --save`
